**mulle-test** can test your C or Objective C library. But it can also test
shell scripts or binaries. Basically anything that creates text output.

The loop **mulle-test** performs is *compile*, *execute*, *diff*. A test always
fails, if the return code is not 0. A test also fails, if there is an expected
output file present, and the test output differs from it.

As you would manually:

``` bash
cc -o a.out a.c
./a.out > a.result
diff a.stdout a.result
```
